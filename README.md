### You need to add your own config.json that needs to have:


```json
{
  "token": "insert bot token",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "updateDate": "13.05.2019",
  "embedColor": "6648024",
  "channel_name": "insert the name of the channel where the messages are sent"
}
```

### where: 
- token is the bot's token that you get when creating the bot to API
- embedcolor is the  bordercolor of the message on discord
- channel_name the name of the channel where the messages should be sent in each server
- version and update date are just printed when the bot starts and serve no real purpose

## Planning to add:
- Saving 5-10 latest posts to memory in order to prevent dublicates
- more sources to find free game notifications from
